# My-Project
**Project:** Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with GitHub webhook integration for Deploying Docker application on EC2 instances using the declarative pipeline.

# Overview:
This project demonstrates the setup of an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a web application(django-app) on AWS EC2 instances using Jenkins and Docker. It includes GitHub webhook integration to trigger pipeline runs on every code commit, ensuring continuous integration and delivery. 

**Description**:
  - The project automates the deployment of a web application on AWS EC2 instances.
  - Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub webhooks are used to streamline the CI/CD pipeline.
  - The pipeline includes Git integration, Docker image building, and container deployment.
    
**Notable Achievements**:
    - Reduced deployment time by **50%** through automation, enabling immediate live application updates after code commits.
    - Eliminated manual intervention, enhancing software delivery efficiency.
    - Improved application scalability and reliability.
